# WooCommerce Pay Title

Allows you to set a custom payment method title that is only displayed on the checkout page. This can be used to display meaningful instructions to the user on the checkout page (e.g. "Pay with PayPal") and only display the payment method title (e.g. "PayPal") elsewhere in emails, in the admin etc.

## Installation
Download a zipball and upload it to your plugins directory or clone this repository to your installation. This is GitHub, you probably know how to install a WordPress plugin.

## Usage
Just upload and activate! Adds a "Checkout title" option on all payment gateway settings screens after the "Title" option. There are no settings.
